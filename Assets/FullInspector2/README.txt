### Full Inspector

Welcome to the trial for Full Inspector! I hope you enjoy the product. If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email (find it on the website, jacobdufault.github.io/fullinspector, or create a new issue at https://github.com/jacobdufault/fullinspector/issues?state=open).

Congratulations! Full Inspector provides an awesome inspector and serialization experience for the full range of .NET types.

Please look under `Samples` for some demos on how to use Full Inspector (it's really simple, regardless).

This trial is fully featured. However, when you try to build a project, you will get errors regarding references to UnityEditor types. Please purchase Full Inspector to remove these errors and also get access to the full source code.

Enjoy,
Jacob
